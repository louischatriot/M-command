M-command
=========

Provides the same functionality as Vim's M command: place anchors on a web page and navigate between them.  

Typing `mk` drops mark **k** where you currently are in the page. Later, typing `'k` brings you back to where you were when you dropped the mark. `k` can be any letter from a to z.

## Chrome extension
The best way to use it is to load it as an unpacked extension from chrome (settings > load unpacked extension > select the 'extension' folder). This way it will work on any website, as long as it's activated.


## Bookmarklet
That was the first step of development, but is still usable, if you have a local web server. This is not practical and not recommended.
